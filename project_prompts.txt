# Project Prompts for Gut Balance Buddy

This file contains the prompts and requests made during the development of this project.

## Authentication & UI Changes

1. **Remove Google Sign-in Option**
   - Request: "Please remove the continue with google option on the sign in page"
   - Action: Removed Google OAuth button and separator from the Auth.tsx page

2. **Fix Sign-out Functionality**
   - Request: "seems when i clicked on sign out button, it didn't work, can you fix it, it should go back to the log in page"
   - Action: Updated UserMenu component to properly handle sign-out with navigation and toast notifications
   - Updated useAuth hook to clear local state properly

3. **Fix Sign-out Error Handling**
   - Request: "it said sign out error" (with screenshot showing AuthSessionMissingError)
   - Action: Enhanced error handling in useAuth.tsx signOut function to handle missing session errors gracefully
   - Added checks for existing session before attempting sign out
   - Added fallback to clear local state even when session errors occur

4. **Create Documentation File**
   - Request: "create a file 'project_prompts.txt' with the prompts used and save it to the repo"
   - Action: Created this documentation file to track development prompts and changes

## Technical Notes

- The app uses Supabase for authentication
- Sign-out errors were occurring due to session state mismatches
- Error handling was improved to gracefully handle AuthSessionMissingError
- Local state is now properly cleared regardless of Supabase session state
