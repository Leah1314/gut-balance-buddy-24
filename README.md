# Gut Health In-&-Out
## Summary
Gut Balance Buddy was developed to empower users with personalized insights into their gut health, leveraging an image recognition model (ChatGPT-4.1) for food and stool analysis, and embedding models (openai/gpt-4o-mini) to understand user data contextually. We incorporated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to tailor recommendations and advice based on individual user profiles and food history, ensuring a highly personalized experience. We believe at least user health record and food-stool history contextualises the gut health chat. Vibe coding (lovable) played a crucial role in rapidly prototyping and iterating on the app's user interface, allowing us to create an intuitive and engaging platform that resonates with users' needs.

## Overview
Gut Balance Buddy is a comprehensive web application designed to help users monitor and improve their gut health. With features like food diary tracking, stool analysis, symptom logging, and personalized coaching, the app provides actionable insights and recommendations.
